CARD_DESC_00=In Smithers' debut episode, he was originally black. This was merely an animation glitch but due to the low budget back then, he couldn't be reversed. Welp, there go the people complaining about little diversity...
CARD_DESC_01=The cash register gag is quite a strange one, the meaning behind it's value is the cost per month to raise a child in the 80's! Neat, huh?
CARD_DESC_02=Bart's blue shirt has always been quite the mystery, it was used on official Bart Simpson merch to differentiate between fakes and legit merch being sold during the 90's. Alot of fakes were being produced at the time, he's never been seen in the show with this shirt.
CARD_DESC_03=Homer's two best pals have always been rumoured to of been Homosexuals, but this is just merely a joke made by the creators. Much like the Marge and Lenny joke. 
CARD_DESC_04=Homer's old arch nemesis Frank Grimes. He met his death from electricution after he had enough of Homer's stupid antics and slack, he went on a violent sporadic rampage around the nuclear plant before his untimely death.
CARD_DESC_05=George (DerpyDosh) is one half of the TOS team, which consists of only 2 people. Scripter: Will Johnson, and vehicle porter: George James. George has made some impressive vehicle mods and has been doing so for a while.
CARD_DESC_06=These damn modders with their self-indulgency ugghhh, we get it you made the mod. This guy scripted alot of the things ingame and retextured a few things. He's the other half of the TOS Team.

MISSION_OBJECTIVE_01=Hey Homer! Thought I'd never see 'ya down here so early.

MISSION_OBJECTIVE_04=Huh? Why's that? Something bothering 'ya?
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_05=My wife's gone missing! And only now the voices in my head start to make sense!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_06=And to think for years I thought they were telling me gibberish...
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_07=Well, wish I could help 'ya with it, but I got my own problems.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_08=My ticket to the Duff Brewery Tour's been stolen.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_09=What?! No one's love for beer should be messed with! That's outrageous!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_10=Listen Lenny, maybe you could find a lawyer or someone like that to deal with this mess.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_11=Homer, How'dya know if there's any lawyers around this area anyways?!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_12=I saw one drive to the brewery a minute ago... just as I handed my ticket in and left the place.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_13=You're attending too? That does it! I'm not gonna sit here alone while my friends are having a good time!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_14=DRIVE TO THE DUFF BREWERY.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_15=THE CURATOR'S LEAVING! FOLLOW HIM UNTIL HE STOPS.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_16=FIND A PLACE FOR FOOD. ANY WILL DO AS LONG AS HE GETS IT FREE!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_17=THAT DONUT TRUCK LOOKS GOOD. ORDER SOME DONUTS FROM THE TRUCK.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_18=Yeah, I'd like to order two #9's and a #6 with extra dip.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_19=That'll be $10.57 sir...
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_20=...Oh no! I haven't payed rent in 8 months!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_21=UH OH, THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. GET IN YOUR VEHICLE!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_22=HE'S GETTING AWAY! HIT HIS VAN TO COLLECT THE DONUTS!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_23=Sir! I need to speak with you about something, it's urgent!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_24=Christ, another *? Look pal, it's been a long day for me of sorting *'s problems out.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_25=You're no different from the rest of them. It's a rare opportunity a curator actually gets a break
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_26=and even rarer that they'll be given free food for their crippling work.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_27=Now back away and let me enjoy my evening!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_28=(Sounds like he's had a rough day. Well, I'd better make the anticipated legend come true!)

MISSION_OBJECTIVE_30=DRIVE TO PLANET HYPE.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_31=TALK TO THE CURATOR. 
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_32=GET IN YOUR VEHICLE.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_33=That guy must be crazy to drive away from a customer on duty! Oh well, better take these back.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_34=DRIVE TO THE BOWLORAMA.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_35=Well, any second thoughts sir?
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_36=Oh my god, #6's with dip! These are my favourite!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_37=Mmmm... good stuff. Now, what exactly was your enquiry again?
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_38=My ticket to the brewery's been stolen, do you think you can help find the perpetrator?
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_39=Well it's not like I can do that if you don't have any evidence to present, can I?
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_40=I'd just recommend buying another ticket from that fatass that runs the Android's Dungeon.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_41=But I'm pretty much broke! Spent all my hard earned money on that ticket and now it's gone!
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_42=Well then, look for work around town! I'm sure they'd be willing to put change in 'yer pockets.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_43=I'm sorry pal, but look's like you're on your own. There's nothing I can do.
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_44=Good luck in your future findings, and one more thing:
MISSION_OBJECTIVE_45=Thanks for the donuts! (Sucker, not like I was gonna help him anyway...)
